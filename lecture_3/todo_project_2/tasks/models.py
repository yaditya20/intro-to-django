from django.db import models


# Create your models here.

# ORM - Object Relational Mapper
# Takes your python objects, and stores them as database tables and rows
# Models for tables


# Low Level Design
# Requirements
# - [User] can add [Task]s
# - a task can be tagged with one or more [Tag]s
# - you can search for tasks by content, or by a tag
# - tasks can have an urgency and an importance
# - tasks can have a status - Pending, Completed, Dropped

# Detect nouns -> usually become entities/models
# Detect attributes and relationships


# model, view, controller are decoupled


# Django provides an id field to all model class by default
# makes the id field an integer, which autoincrement and is the primary key
# you can override
class Tag(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

# Create a rich API for us for free


class Task(models.Model):  # class => table
    content = models.TextField()  # field => column in the table
    deadline = models.DateTimeField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField()
    completed_at = models.DateTimeField()
    tag = models.ManyToManyField(Tag)

    class TastStatus(models.TextChoices): # enumeration
        COMPLETED = "CO", "Completed"
        PENDING = "PE", "Pending"
        DROPPED = "DR", "Dropped"
    status = models.CharField(
        choices=TastStatus.choices,
        default=TastStatus.PENDING,
        max_length=2,
    )  # must have restricted set of choices

# whenever I change my DB schema
# - my old DB is now useless
# - create a new DB?
# - somehow re-enter the data in the new DB => hefty task
# - I don't want the users to re-enter the data
# Migration - Migrate the previous data to new DB
# approach 1 - delete DB, create new DB, enter data myself
# approach 2 - write a Migration script that looks at the previous DB,
#              and copies the data to the new DB
# Whenever I change my schema, I have to write this script again and again
# I have the previous DB schema
# I have the current models in Django
# Can I write a script that automatically find the differences and writes the migration script for me?
# Django provides this out of the box

# 1 task can have 1 or more tags
# 1 tag (like shopping) can also have multiple tasks
# Many-to-Many Relationship

# Task_Tags =>
# id | task_id (foreign key to tasks_task.id) | tag_id

# OneToOne Relationship => column in your tables
# OneToMany Relationship => column in your tables
# ManyToOne Relationship => column in your tables
# ManyToMany Relationship => create a new table for this
